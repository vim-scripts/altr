*altr* is a Vim plugin to switch files easily.

For example, suppose that you are developing a Vim plugin which is called
"foo".  You often edit specific files such as "autoload/foo.vim",
"doc/foo.txt", "plugin/foo.vim", etc.  Sometimes one of the files is not
displayed in any window.  So you have to open the missing file explicitly.
But there are many ways to open the missing file.  How do you open the missing
file?  |:edit|, |:buffer|, or your favorite buffer-management plugin?

Whatever you choose, you have to type some keys to specify what the missing
file is.  So there is no way to open the missing file WITHOUT INTERACTION.
You'll probably wish if there is a command to open the missing file without
interaction.  This plugin, altr, provides the command.

The best keys and Ex commands to open the missing file are varied for each
user.  So that altr doesn't define neither the default keys nor the default Ex
commands.  See |altr-examples| for details.
